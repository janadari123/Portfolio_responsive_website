        As an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Information
        and Communication Technology with a specialization in software
        technology at the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka, I am
        eager to apply my technical skills and passion for software
        development in a software engineer intern role. I am committed
        to contributing my knowledge, creativity, and strong work ethic to
